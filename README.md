# My work
I wanted to let you know that this was my first intro into unit testing.  I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to do it.  I certainly can see why people enjoy testing as a career.  There's something really satisfying about creating tests that demonstrate the accuracy/purpose of your code.

While I know I couldn't get them all -- I did decide to write about my experience with this test.  Here's the link:  https://medium.com/@lclark070607/turning-code-test-anxieties-into-opportunities-to-learn-my-intro-to-unit-testing-with-chai-70326844e322

Many thanks!
